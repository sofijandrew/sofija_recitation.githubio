      <h1>architecture</h1>
      <p>Every building has a story, and every story begins as a mess of sketches and brown box structures (or something like that). Architecture has a special place in my heart. I thrive in the collaborative and structural design process buildings require, and enjoy creating to solve a purpose for a group of people, no matter how big or small. </p>

        <div class="flex-item-left"><p>This model is an abstraction study of the Clyfford Still Museum. It demonstrates spatial organization through the use of walls and how they dictate the flow and feeling of a space.This exploration expresses the way the museum feels open and light, even in places of enclosure. Opportunity for movement and sight lines are never fully closed off, giving way to vertical, horizontal, and diagonal direction. The Clyfford Still Museum is a three-dimensional and dynamic experience, so this model was created to be seen at all different angles and explored in a dynamic way.</p></div>
