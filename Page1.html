      <p>This project is an exploration of interactive design systems and traditional acrylic painting that engages the viewer in a new way. I created a circuit that integrates with the canvas and wrote code that reacts when the viewer comes within 16” of the canvas, an LED strip lights up and brightly flashes different colors. People don’t get the chance to get up close to art anymore, so this painting speaks back and engages the viewer in a new and intriguing way.</p>
